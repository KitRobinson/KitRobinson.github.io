		<h2>Welcome the the Chronicle of Palomar!</h2>
		<h3>What is the Chronicle of Palomar?</h3>
		<p>  The Chronicle of Palomar is an forum based game, where players take on the role of a deity in the world of Palomar.  As players you will guide your worshippers, shape the world, and engage in heavenly diplomacy - but choose your allies carefully!

		<h3>How do I create a character?</h3>
		<p>Character creation occurs in three stages, but before we begin, you should have an outline for your deity - this will help you have an overall concept, help me to ajudicate any special rules needed, and also will allow me to follow through on the basic plan, should you be unable to participate in one of these steps.</p>
		<p> Deities have three basic things which define them:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Portfolios</li>
			<li>Deific Powers</li>
			<li>Deific Stats</li>
		</ol>
		<h4>Portfolios</h4>
		<p> A portfolio is an area of responsibility for your deity - your portfolios define what you are the god of.  In greek mythology for example, Poseidon was the god of the sea, and of horses - so Poseidon would have the <strong>Sea</strong> and <strong>Horses</strong> portfolios.  Each portfolio has a minimum point cost, but you can pay more if you like - the more points invested in a portfolio, the more effect it will have in the world of Palomar.  Below you will find a few examples, but players are encouraged to define their own portfolios!</p>
		<table border="1">
			<tr>
				<th>Portfolio</th>
				<th>Minimum Cost</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Death</td>
				<td>50</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Knowledge</td>
				<td>50</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Sea</td>
				<td>40</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Strength</td>
				<td>40</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Metal</td>
				<td>35</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Law</td>
				<td>30</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Revels</td>
				<td>25</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Artists</td>
				<td>20</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Lakes</td>
				<td>15</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Doors</td>
				<td>10</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>The West Wind</td>
				<td>5</td>
			</tr>
			</table>
			<h4>Divine Powers</h4>
			<p>Each deity also has a selection of divine powers.  Every deity has certain basic powers - to bless or curse things within their portfolios (for example, the God of Harvests could expend divine energy either to create a bumper crop, or a blighted harvest) and to insipre their followers... but there are an infinite number of other possibilities!  For example, the God of Storms might like to be able to smite things with lightning, and the God of Secrets might like to be able to compel truth from mortals.  In order to gain a power, you must have an appropraite portfolio, and must pay some points.</p>
